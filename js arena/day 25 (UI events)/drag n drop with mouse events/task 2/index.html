<!--     This task can help you to check understanding of several aspects of Drag’n’Drop and DOM.

Make all elements with class draggable – draggable. Like a ball in the chapter.

Requirements:

Use event delegation to track drag start: a single event handler on document for mousedown.
If elements are dragged to top/bottom window edges – the page scrolls up/down to allow further dragging.
There is no horizontal scroll (this makes the task a bit simpler, adding it is easy).
Draggable elements or their parts should never leave the window, even after swift mouse moves.
The demo is too big to fit it here, so here’s the link.

Demo in new window -->
<h2>Place superheroes around the soccer field.</h2>

  <p>Superheroes and the ball are elements with the class "draggable". Make them really draggable.</p>

  <p>Important: limit dragging by the window. If a draggable reaches window top or bottom, then the page should scroll to let us drag it further.</p>

  <p>If your screen is big enough to fit the whole document -- make the window smaller to get vertical scrolling, so that you could test it.</p>

  <p>In this task it's enough to handle vertical scrolling. There's no horizontal scrolling usually, and it's handled the similar way if needed.</p>

  <p>And one more thing: heroes may never leave the page. If they reach the edge of the document, no dragging outside of it.</p>

  <div id="field">
